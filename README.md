## Example Neo4j Graph App
Built with `create-react-app` and uses [graph-app-kit](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graph-app-kit) components to display their usage.  
This app assumes that it runs where the Neo4j Desktop API is available.

This app works on local db:s with no auth, or on remote connections (with or without auth).
